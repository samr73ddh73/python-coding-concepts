#Intuition:
Use two pointers : slow (tortoise üê¢ ) and fast (hare üêá ). The slow pointer moves one step at a time, while the fast pointer moves two steps at a time. If there's a cycle, the fast pointer will eventually meet the slow pointer inside the cycle. If there's no cycle, the fast pointer will reach the end of the list.
